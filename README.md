# hack-a-thing-2 coreML

Manmeet Gujral and Kevin Farmer

### What we built

We built an iOS app that uses coreML to attempt to determine what an object in a picture is. This can be an image captured from the app, or a pre-existing photo from the phone's photo library.

### Who did what

We did partner-programming for the whole thing, I (Kevin) borrowed a Mac since this was an iOS project, but was having issues building with Xcode so we used Manmeet's laptop. 

### What we learned

We mostly learned about building an iOS app and connecting Swift code to the UI. We also learned about integrating coreML into this, which pretty much does all of the machine learning part for you.

### What didn't work

The coreML model that we used was pre-built and is far from perfectly accurate with its predictions. We also had some difficulties connecting the code to the UI in Xcode, but worked that out. 

### Credits

We used the following tutorial to learn about coreML and iOS:
